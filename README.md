## project3
In this project, the goal is to implement a complicated system that are related to our team project. As a result, I choose to implement a machine learning model using pytorch. As in Visual Question Answering, classifing images to certain catogories seems to be crucial, so in this case I chose to run a image classification trasnfer leaning module.
